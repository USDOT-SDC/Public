# USDOT Secure Data Commons Primary Public Project

The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) Secure Data Commons (SDC) is a cloud-based analytics platform that enables traffic engineers, researchers, and data scientists to access transportation-related datasets. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) created the SDC to provide a secure platform for sharing and collaborating on research, tools, algorithms, and analysis involving moderate sensitivity level (PII & CBI) datasets using commercially available tools, without needing to install tools or software locally.
